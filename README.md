# SedEdu

SedEdu is a suite of educational activities related to geomorphology and sedimentology. The suite is targeted at grade school educators who want to bring enagaging, interactive, and scientifically relevant activities into their classroom. SedEdu is built entirely in Python and is *free and open source* software. Modules included in SedEdu are built by reseachers at the cutting edge of their fields and are designed to showcase their research in a digestable manner.


## Getting Started
